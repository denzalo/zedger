## **Betstamp**

### **Pricing at a glance**
|Tier|Who it's for|What you get|Published Price*|
|----|------------|------------|---------------|
|Betstamp (Free)|Casual-to-serious bettors who mainly want help shopping lines and tracking results|<ul><li>Real-time odds screen for dozens of sportsbooks<li>Bet-tracking with CLV & ROI analytics<li>Community feed to follow other users’ picks</ul>|$0 – free iOS, Android and web app|
|Betstamp PRO|Professional/volume bettors who need a desktop-grade odds screen|<ul><li>Live and pre-game edge highlighting across 100 + sportsbooks<li>Historical line-movement charts<li>Custom “true line” to flag +EV spots<li>Live player-prop screen (soccer launched April 2025)</ul>|“Varied pricing” – you have to request a demo; cost depends on markets/books you want|
|Marketplace / Pick-selling|Cappers who monetise their selections & bettors looking to buy them|<ul><li>Verified pick records and storefronts inside the app</ul>|Revenue-share cut not disclosed publicly (no rate shown in T&Cs)|

*Betstamp does not publish list prices for PRO or its marketplace fees; lack of price transparency itself is a competitive opening.

### **Core Feature Set**
1. **Odds comparison** – side-by-side prices from mainstream U.S./Canadian books, plus niche/off-shore operators in PRO. Live edges are highlighted so users can jump on mis-priced numbers.
2. **Bet tracker & analytics** – users record stakes, automatically log closing-line value and produce ROI breakdowns by sport, market and bet type.
3. **Player-prop research tool** – rapid prop-odds lookup across the major U.S. sports; launched on mobile and rolled out to soccer in April 2025.
4. **Social layer** – follow friends or verified cappers; public leader-boards showcase long-term ROI.
5. **Content & community** – “Circles Off” podcast, blog, and ambassador programme keep bettors engaged and drive acquisition.

### **Where Betstamp falls short - gaps we can exploit**
|Gap|Why it Matters|Opportunity for our MVP|
|---|---|---|
|Opaque, high-touch pricing for PRO|Forced sales call erects friction, especially for mid-level bettors who aren’t yet “pro.”|Self-serve tier at a transparent flat fee (or usage-based) to capture the long tail.|
|No predictive engine – only execution help|Users still need their own models/edges; Betstamp won’t tell them what to bet.|Embed AI-driven signal generation, bet-sizing (e.g., Kelly), or crowd-sourced model marketplace.|
|Sports-book-only coverage|Ignores prediction markets (Polymarket, Kalshi) and crypto-native books; no multi-asset support.|Position Zedger as the cross-venue “terminal” covering sportsbooks and on-chain markets, letting users arbitrage edges others can’t see.|
|Limited bankroll tooling|Tracking stops at win/loss; no capital-at-risk view, multi-currency accounting or tax logs.|Offer full portfolio analytics: cash-, crypto- and token-denominated P&L, auto-journaled trades, exportable tax packs.|
|Closed ecosystem / no API|Power users can’t pull odds or their own history into spreadsheets or code.|Ship an open GraphQL/REST API from day one; drive developer adoption and partnerships.|
|Marketplace credibility concerns|Fee structure + variable pick quality make some bettors wary; no performance-based pricing.|Curate “model sellers” with verified sharpe ratios, let creators charge performance fees, and escrow payouts.|

### **Takeaways**
- **Differentiate on insights, not just line shopping.** Lead with an edge-discovery engine (AI/quant or community-driven) that Betstamp simply doesn’t provide. Or use polymarket as the true odds.

- **Win on transparency.** Publish pricing, offer a generous free tier, and automate upgrades instead of forcing demos.

- **Own prediction-market & crypto coverage early.** Betstamp’s compliance focus keeps them in regulated sportsbooks; we can be first to unify fiat books with USDC-settled markets.

- **Treat data as a platform.** An open API and downloadable CSVs make us the centre of power-user workflows – something Betstamp users routinely complain about on Reddit.

## **Pikkit**

### **Pricing at a glance**
|Tier|Who it's for|What you get|Published price*|
|---|---|---|---|
|Pikkit (Free)|Casual bettors who mainly want automated bet-tracking and a social feed|<ul><li>BookSync auto-sync for 30 + U.S./Canadian sportsbooks<li>Basic line-shopping & live score screen<li>Bet-tracking dashboard (ROI, win %, unit P&L)<li>Public & private leaderboards, friend feed</ul>|$0 – iOS & Android app|
|Pikkit Pro|Power users who want deep analytics & alerts|Everything in Free plus<ul><li>CLV tracking, exposure/conflict view<li>“Scenario Analysis” for multi-leg markets<li>Odds & market-open alerts, SGP line-shopper<li>Promo/rewards centre, futures tracking<li>Data export (CSV), web app access, Discord support|$39.99 / mo or $299.99 / yr (7-day trial via in-app purchase)|

*Pikkit sets pricing only in the app stores; the marketing site lists features but omits the dollar figure, forcing users to click through the store page.

### **Core Feature Set**
1. **BookSync auto-import** – one-click credential link to 30+ regulated books & DFS sites; no manual entry.
2. **Advanced analytics (Pro)** – Closing-Line-Value charts, exposure/conflict heat-map, and scenario payouts for overlapping bets.
3. **Line shopping** – compare odds—including SGP builder—for any market across linked books, with custom “only show my books” filter.
4. **Alerts & promo hub** – push notifications when a market opens, a price crosses your target, or a boost/free-bet is expiring.
5. **Social layer** – public leaderboards, follow/tail verified sharps, private friends feed, year-end “Instant Replay” wrap-up of your stats.

### **Where Pikkit falls short - gaps we can exploit**
|Gap|Why it matters|Opportunity for our MVP|
|---|---|---|
|No manual bet entry / CSV import|Unsupported books (e.g., Bet365), on-chain venues, or historical bets can’t be recorded—users complain their P&L is “completely false.”|Accept manual uploads & generic CSV; auto-de-dupe so users get a full picture of ROI.|
|High, opaque Pro price|$40 / mo is sticker shock for mid-level bettors; price isn’t shown on web page, only in-app.|Transparent, self-serve tiers (e.g., $9 – 19) or usage-based billing; show price on landing page.|
|30-book ceiling, no crypto/prediction-market coverage|Bettors who arb across offshore, crypto, or Polymarket have to track elsewhere.|Be first to aggregate sportsbooks + crypto + prediction markets, with multi-currency accounting.|
|All execution, zero insight|Like Betstamp, Pikkit tells you how you did, not what to bet next.|Ship edge-discovery: AI pattern mining, crowd-sourced models, Kelly sizing suggestions.|
|Closed ecosystem|No public API; power users can’t pull their data into Python/R or spreadsheets.|Open REST/GraphQL from day one; encourage community dashboards & bot builders.|
|No monetisation marketplace|Sharps build a following but can’t sell picks or models inside Pikkit.|Curated “model store” with rev-share & performance-fee options.|

### **Takeaways**
- **Solve the “unsupported book & old bets” pain first.** Simple CSV/manual import is a low-lift feature that Pikkit users beg for and will immediately differentiate us.
- **Lead with multi-venue coverage.** Add on-chain books and prediction markets to own the whitespace Pikkit ignores.
- **Price transparently and lower the floor.** A clear $10 – $15 starter tier (or usage-based) undercuts Pikkit’s $40 gate and captures the long-tail bettor segment.
- **Provide *actionable* signals.** Layer AI/model marketplace on top of tracking to move from retrospective stats to forward-looking edges—Pikkit’s biggest blind spot.
- **Make data portable.** API + exports turn Zedger into the “Bloomberg-terminal” layer others build on, locking in power users and partners.

By addressing these gaps, we position Zedger as the smarter, more open, and more affordable alternative that scales from crypto-native quants to weekend parlay players—territory where Pikkit can’t currently follow.

## **Juice Reel**

### **Pricing at a glance**

|Tier|Who it's for|What you get|Published price*|
|---|---|---|---|
|Juice Reel (Free)|Anyone who wants automated bet-tracking plus AI & crowd data without paying a dime|<ul><li>Auto-sync from 300 + sportsbooks/DFS sites<li>Live in-play P&L screen<li>Personal analytics (ROI, sport/team splits)<li>Two “Juice Picks” AI bets each day<li>Sharp-vs-Square consensus feed</ul>|$0 – iOS & Android only|

*Juice Reel publishes no public price sheet; free download is obvious, but premium fees surface only inside the app or in media coverage—an opening for us.

### **Core Feature Set**

1. **One-tap BetSync (300 + books).** Real-time import for mainstream U.S. books, DFS sites and many off-shores—no spreadsheets needed.
2. **Live “Juice” screen.** In-game win/loss swings update every play, turning the app into a scoreboard for your bankroll.
3. **AI-driven “Juice Picks”.** The app drops two model-generated edges per day (extra on weekends) with probability & line shop built in.
4. **Sharp-vs-Square consensus + SharpMush™.** Crowd analytics flag what the best bettors back—and what the public hammers.
5. **Transparent pick marketplace.** Bettors can sell feeds; every record is auto-verified through BetSync to kill fake ROI screenshots.

### **Where Juice Reel falls short - gaps we can exploit**

|Gap|Why it matters|Opportunity for MVP|
|---|---|---|
|Pricing black box (credits + hidden $ fees)|Users can’t tell upfront what “going premium” costs; friction and distrust.|Ship crystal-clear, dollar-denominated tiers on the landing page.|
|Mobile-only, no web or API|Power users can’t analyse data in Python/R or view dashboards on desktop.|Launch with a responsive web app plus open GraphQL/REST endpoints; become the platform others build on.|
|No manual bet entry / CSV import|Unsupported books or old wagers skew stats; reviewers complain their ROI is “completely false.”|Offer bulk CSV & manual entry with smart de-dupe so bettors see their whole picture.|
|Token-gated pro tools|One-off micro-purchases confuse users and limit stickiness.|Bundle advanced features into a transparent monthly plan—or usage-based billing—to maximise retention.|
|Sportsbook-only universe|Ignores crypto books & prediction markets—no way to track USDC or Polymarket action.|Cover fiat, on-chain & prediction markets from day one, positioning us as the cross-venue “terminal.”|
|Closed marketplace economics	|Pick sellers set flat prices; no performance-fee, rev-share or model API.|Curate a *model* marketplace with performance-fee options and programmable signals.|

### **Takeaways**

- **Lead with data portability.** Desktop dashboard + open API instantly outflank Juice Reel’s walled-garden mobile app.
- **Fix “stat-hole” pain.** CSV/manual imports are the #1 gripe—easy win for early adopter love.
- **Price transparently and simply.** A clear $10–$15 starter tier (or usage billing) turns Juice Reel’s credit maze into our selling point.
- **Own the multi-venue narrative.** By marrying traditional books with on-chain and prediction markets, we attack the whitespace none of the incumbent trackers touch.
- **Go beyond tracking to edge discovery.** Layer AI signal engine + performance-fee model store; Juice Reel gives picks, but not the infrastructure for others to build on.

Executing on those angles positions Zedger as the open, insight-driven and market-agnostic alternative—capturing sharps who outgrow Juice Reel and newbies who never want to wrestle with hidden costs.

## **Action Network**

### **Pricing at a glance**
|Tier|Who it's for|What you get|Published price*|
|---|---|---|---|
|Action App (Free)|Bettors who mainly want a live odds screen, manual bet tracker and social feed|<ul><li>Real-time odds & line-movement screen<li>Manual bet entry + ticket-share feed<li>Follow friends & “experts” picks stream</ul>|$0 — iOS & Android|
|Action Edge / PRO|Users who want the data signals Action is famous for|Everything Free gives plus<ul><li>BetSync auto-import from partner books<li>Public-bets & money splits, Sharp-Action & Big-Money signals (PRO Report)<li>CLV tracking, parlay/teaser support, custom alerts<li>Player-prop projections & “Systems” edges|$9.99 /mo or $59.99 / yr in-app purchase (7-day trial)|
|Action Labs (add-on inside PRO)|DIY quants who want to build & back-test betting systems|<ul><li>Historical database & “Systems” builder<li>Hold-% & arbitrage scanner<li>Save/auto-fire system alerts</ul>|Price not listed publicly; surfaced only after sign-in — a transparency gap|

*Action publishes no pricing table on its marketing site; paid rates appear only in the app stores or post-login paywalls.

### **Core Feature Set**
1. **BetSync auto-import** – any wager placed at a linked U.S. book lands in your Action ledger instantly; no manual entry needed.
2. **Live odds & line history** – consensus and book-specific prices update in real time across major sports.
3. **Public-money & sharp-action data** – PRO Report flags mismatches between ticket % and handle %, plus Bet Signals when respected books move.
4. **Closing-Line-Value & portfolio stats** – see CLV per bet and ROI splits by sport/market.
5. **Systems / Labs tools** – point-and-click model builder on 15 + years of historical data; live hold-% and arbitrage finder.
6. **Content & community layer** – expert picks, podcasts, Action AI–generated articles, and a follow feed of friends or verified cappers.

### **Where Action Network falls short - gaps we can exploit**
|Gap|Why it matters|Opportunity for our MVP|
|---|---|---|
|Pricing hidden behind app stores & paywalls|Users must download the app before learning PRO costs, and Labs has no public rate card — erodes trust.|Publish clear, flat-fee (or usage-based) tiers on the landing page.|
|Partner-book ceiling (~10-15 books)|Bets placed at offshore, crypto or niche exchanges require manual entry; CSV bulk import is absent, skewing P & L.|Accept CSV/manual uploads with auto-de-dupe; support any venue so ROI is complete.|
|No crypto / prediction-market coverage|Users dabbling in Polymarket, Kalshi or on-chain books must track those wagers elsewhere.|Be first to unify fiat sportsbooks and on-chain markets, with multi-currency accounting.|
|Closed ecosystem (no public API)|Power users can’t pull odds or history into Python/R; integration hacks flourish on Reddit.|Ship an open REST/GraphQL API plus web dashboard from day one.|
|Edge discovery still content-driven|PRO gives signals but not customizable sizing, bankroll or AI-generated bet recommendations.|Layer AI bet-selection & Kelly sizing, or host a model marketplace with performance-fee options.|

### **Takeaways**
- **Lead on transparency.** A plainly advertised $10-ish starter tier (or usage pricing) contrasts sharply with Action’s hidden rates.
- **Solve the “stat-hole” pain.** CSV / manual imports + unlimited venue support delight bettors whose Action ROI is incomplete.
- **Own multi-venue tracking.** Unify sportsbooks, crypto books and prediction markets to occupy ground Action doesn’t even map.
- **Provide programmable edges.** An open API and model marketplace turn our app into the Bloomberg-style hub builders plug into—something Action’s walled garden prevents.
- **Go beyond tracking to intelligent execution.** AI signal engine, bankroll-aware sizing and cross-venue arbitrage alerts shift us from retrospective stats to actionable advantage.

Executing on these angles positions Zedger as the open, insight-driven and truly market-agnostic alternative—ready to win the bettors Action leaves underserved.
